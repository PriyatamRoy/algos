# I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:

# The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
# The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
# For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

# No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

# walk through stock prices array
#  if current price greater than last price
#   current_profit = current_price - current_base
# else
#   current_base = current_price
# end

# best_profit = max(current_profit, best_profit)
